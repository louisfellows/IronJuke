Before running the Iron Juke, set the text in the locationStr.txt file to the root 
directory of your music collection. Start the Iron Juke by double clicking the .jar
file. You will need java installed!

The tracks need to be in a folder which has the name of the Album, and the albums need 
to be in a folder with the name of the Artist. For Example, for 'Heart of a Dragon' from 
'Valley of the Damned' by 'Dragonforce' the folders should be 

       <root directory>/Dragonforce/Valley of the Damned/Heart of a Dragon.mp3

The pictures for the albums are taken from the folders. If the program finds a jpg, png 
or bmp image called cover (cover.jpg, cover.png, cover.bmp) it'll use that, failing that
it'll use any image it finds, failing the failing that it'll use the noimg.png file.

It you want it to look different you can change the two images in the main folder.

Select a song by typing the album code followed by the song title. Choosing song 00 will
play the entire album.

Left and Right cycle though pages of albums.

R selects a random track.

Alt+C cancels the current Track.

Alt+Q Exits.


Enjoy!
