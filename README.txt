The Iron Juke

Some (currently quite basic) jukebox software created as a Birthday present for a friend of mine. It’s a little basic, but it might be useful to someone! It’s been found to work really well for house parties with a computer wired to the TV and the sound system and a Wireless keyboard to select songs (or, just a computer set up in the corner!)
